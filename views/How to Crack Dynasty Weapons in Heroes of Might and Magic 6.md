Before we begin, please note that this method may not work for all Dynasty Weapons, and it may have some risks or consequences. We do not endorse or encourage cracking Dynasty Weapons, and we are not responsible for any damage or loss that may occur as a result. Use this method at your own discretion and risk.
 
## The Trick
 
The trick is based on the fact that Dynasty Weapons have different levels of abilities depending on your hero's level. For example, the Iron Feather weapon has five tiers of abilities, each unlocked at a certain hero level: 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20. However, these levels are not fixed, and they can be changed by editing a file in your game folder.
 
To do this, you need to locate the file called "DynastyWeapon.xml" in your game folder. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Might & Magic Heroes VI\Data\GameMechanics\Items\Weapons. You can also use the search function in your file explorer to find it.
 
Once you find the file, make a backup copy of it in case something goes wrong. Then, open it with a text editor such as Notepad. You will see a lot of code lines like this:

    <DynastyWeapon id="IronFeather" name="IronFeather" description="IronFeatherDescription" icon="IronFeatherIcon" model="IronFeatherModel">
        <Ability id="IronFeatherAbility1" level="1" />
        <Ability id="IronFeatherAbility2" level="5" />
        <Ability id="IronFeatherAbility3" level="10" />
        <Ability id="IronFeatherAbility4" level="15" />
        <Ability id="IronFeatherAbility5" level="20" />
    </DynastyWeapon>

These lines define the abilities of the Iron Feather weapon and the levels at which they are unlocked. To crack this weapon, you simply need to change the level values to lower numbers, such as 1 or 0. For example:

    <DynastyWeapon id="IronFeather" name="IronFeather" description="IronFeatherDescription" icon="IronFeatherIcon" model="IronFeatherModel">
        <Ability id="IronFeatherAbility1" level="0" />
        <Ability id="IronFeatherAbility2" level="0" />
        <Ability id="IronFeatherAbility3" level="0" />
        <Ability id="IronFeatherAbility4" level="0" />
        <Ability id="IronFeatherAbility5" level="0" />
    </DynastyWeapon>

Save the file and close it. Now, when you start the game and equip the Iron Feather weapon on any hero, you will have all its abilities unlocked from the start.
 
## The Limitations
 
As mentioned earlier, this trick may not work for all Dynasty Weapons. Some weapons may have different or more complex codes that cannot be easily edited. Some weapons may also have abilities that depend on other factors besides your hero's level, such as your dynasty rank or your faction alignment. In these cases, cracking them may not have any effect or may cause errors or glitches.
 
Another limitation is that this trick only works for offline mode. If you try to play online with cracked Dynasty Weapons, you may encounter problems such as synchronization errors or bans
